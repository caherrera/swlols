Stupid White List For Linux Servers

If your company has a very strong security policy and you're requested constantly to sent your common sense whitelist for your linux servers (ok, microsoft as well) you can just download this list and send to them. 

This project is a kind of fork of swot initiative that is sourcing a list of educational institutions for discounts, but applied to guarantee that servers may have access to essential repositories such as docker, github, kernel.org, etc
